# Operating Systems Project

This project has two phases, the first phase demonstrates CPU scheduling and how different algorithms affect performance. The second phase shows each of the 4 deadlock conditions and simulates them with a resolution method.

The files Driver, Process, and Scheduler are all included in phase 1. Running the driver file in a java compiler will output an analysis for 5 hard-coded processes in FCFS and SJF algorithm. This is followed by 5 randomly generated processes that undergo the  same algorithms. The randomly generated processes are for more variety to show different possible runs.

Phase 2 is all included in the DeadlockSimulator file. This program can be ran in a java compiler as well and it will output the 4 different simulations for each condition of a deadlock. It will immediately resolve each deadlock before moving on to the next simulation.
